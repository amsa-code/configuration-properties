Java code migrated from amsa-code/amsa-java/parent/amsa-util for reading configuration properties files.

The original code has been trimmed to the core classes in use in amsa-code and the API simplified significantly. This library is not a drop-in replacement for amsa-util configuration classes, it has breaking changes.
